- ethersjs, eth-brownie, foundry
- ganache, hardhat
- linux, aws, git, ci

## Repos of Note

[RaffleMint](https://github.com/anticlimactic/RaffleMint): a novel ERC721 implementation that attempts to circumvent "unfair" mints by using an on-chain raffle with economic incentives. Participants lock up ether for a period of time to participate. Opportunity cost is high in crypto and thus encourages only loyal community members to participate. Uses foundry for tests.

[RaffleMint-Brownie](https://github.com/anticlimactic/RaffleMint-Brownie): same repo as above, but with eth-brownie for tests/gas optimisation instead of foundry (deprecated now).

[Solidity Examples](https://github.com/anticlimactic/solidity-examples): a collection of solidity example projects (e.g. erc20 implementation, novel index fund implementation etc).

[Gas Optimisations](https://github.com/anticlimactic/gas-optimisations): a repository that takes advantage of foundry's gas snapshot to demonstrate gas optimisations. WIP.

[Yearn's veYfi](https://github.com/anticlimactic/veYfi): submitted some PR's here.
